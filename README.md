# End4Dotfiles

**Minimal · Stable · Understandable Hyprland Setup**

Built after learning the hard way by copying dotfiles without understanding them.  
Everything here is meant to be readable, understandable, and easy to maintain.

## ✦ Overview

**End4Dotfiles** is my personal Hyprland configuration.

I used to copy other people’s dotfiles.  
Upgrades broke my system. Things stopped working. I had no idea why.

So I stopped copying — and started learning.

This setup exists to be:
- stable across updates
- simple in structure
- easy to debug
- fully understandable

No magic. No hidden scripts. No surprises.

> No complex file structure — everything is kept simple and easy to understand.
